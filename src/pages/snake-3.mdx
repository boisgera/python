## Introduction

The aim of this project is to develop an "automatic navigation system" for
our snake, to allow it to reach the fruit despite a complex environment 
with rocks that should be avoided.

## Getting Started

For the sake of simplicity, we will consider here only mazes defined within
a 30x30 grid. We will represent them in Python as sets of pairs of integers
between 0 and 29, where each pair represents the coordinates of an empty
cell of the maze. 
The pair `(0, 0)` corresponds to the top left corner of the grid.

import randomMaze from "/src/assets/random-maze.png";

<figure>
<Image src={randomMaze} alt="A Random Maze" style="border-radius: 0.375rem;margin-left:0; margin-right:0;"/>
<figcaption>

and 25% walls (in black).
</figcaption>
</figure>

## Maze Visualizer

We store the description of such mazes in files, using a 
simple (but undocumented) file format. 
For example the maze displayed above is stored as [`random-maze.py`](../random-maze.py).

  - Download this example maze file.
  
  - Inspect it contents and make an educated guess
    about the file format specification.

  - Construct the maze object `random_maze` associated to this file. 
    

<Admonition type="solution" open={debug}>

The `random-maze.py` file is an (ASCII) text file that contains:

```python
{
    (15, 21),
    (26, 21),
    (7, 17),
    ...
    (18, 8),
}
```

So to begin with, we can load this content as a string `random_maze_repr`:

```python
file = open("random-maze.py", mode="rt", encoding="ascii")
random_maze_repr = file.read()
file.close()
```

This string contains a sequence of integer pairs which seem to represent 
the integer coordinates of the empty maze cells. 
So, we could probably analyze the contents line by line, 
extract the coordinates, etc. For example, the following code 
makes the job:
 
```python
random_maze = set()
for line in random_maze_repr.splitlines():
    line = line.strip()
    if line not in ("{", "}", ""):
        core = line[1:-2]
        x, y = core.split(",")
        x, y = int(x.strip()), int(y.strip())
        random_maze.add((x, y))
```

But we can also notice that the string format is exactly the 
representation that Python uses for sets of pairs of integers.
In this case, that means that we can simply `eval` the string
instead:

```python
random_maze = eval(maze_repr)
```

Additionally, this solution would work even if the file format
had a more compact representation where there are several coordinates 
on the same line.

Finally, after a bit of clean-up, our integrated solution would be:

```python
def load_maze(filename):
    file = open(filename, mode="rt", encoding="ascii")
    maze_repr = file.read()
    file.close()
    maze = eval(maze_repr)
    return maze

random_maze = load_maze("random-maze.py")
```

</Admonition>

### Visualization

Develop a function `draw_maze` to display a maze.
This function should work in the following context:

```python
import pyxel

WIDTH = 30
HEIGHT = 30

random_maze = ...

pyxel.init(WIDTH, HEIGHT)
draw_maze(random_maze)
pyxel.show()
```

<Admonition type="solution" open={debug}>

```python
BLACK = 0
WHITE = 7  # ℹ️ light grey tbh

def display(color, pixels=None):
    if pixels is None:
        pyxel.cls(color)
    elif len(pixels) >= 1 and type(pixels[0]) == int:
        display(color, [pixels])
    else:
        for x, y in pixels:
            pyxel.pset(x, y, color)

def draw_maze(maze):
    display(BLACK)
    display(WHITE, maze)
```

</Admonition>


### Create your own maze

Design your own 30x30 maze, for example the empty maze, 
a spiral, etc.

<Admonition type="solution" open={debug}>

For example to create a maze without walls:

```python
empty_maze = set()
for y in range(0, HEIGHT):
    for x in range(0, WIDTH):
        empty_maze.add((x, y))
```


</Admonition>


## Graphs and Paths

<Admonition type="definition" title="Graph & Vertices, Edges, Weights">

An (oriented and weighted) **graph**  is a triplet composed of:

  - a set of **vertices** (or **nodes**),

  - a set of (oriented) **edges** (or **arcs**), where
    an oriented **edge** is a pair composed of a source vertex and a target vertex.

  - a collection associating to each edge a numerical value called **weight**.

</Admonition>

<Admonition type="definition" title="Path">
A **path** in a graph is a sequence of vertices such that
each element of the sequence and its successor form an edge of the graph.
A path is said to **join** its first vertex to its last vertex.

</Admonition>


### Mazes and Graphs

For each maze we define a graph

  - whose vertices are the empty cells of the maze,

  - whose edges represent the admissible movements from one cell to a neighboring cell
    (the two cells are empty and share a side),

  - for which the weight of each edge is 1; it represents the number of 
    elementary actions (or "cost") needed to move from one cell to a 
    neighboring cell.

Given this definition

  - What Python data structure would we naturally use
    to represent these graphs?

  - Implement a function `maze_to_graph` which builds 
    the graph associated to a maze.

<Admonition type="warning" title="Premature optimization is the root of all evil" open={debug}>
At this stage, we are **not** looking here for the most compact or efficient 
structure but to translate as literally as possible the mathematical description
of the graph.
</Admonition>





<Admonition type="solution" open={debug}>

It seems natural to represent the vertices as a set of pairs of integers, 
the edges as a set of pairs of vertices and the weights as a dictionary having
as keys the edges and as unique value the integer 1.


```python
UP, RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT = (0, -1), (1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0) 

def maze_to_graph(maze):
    vertices = set(maze)
    edges = set()
    weights = {}
    for vertex in vertices:
        x, y = vertex
        for (dx, dy) in [UP, RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT]:
            neighbor = (x + dx, y + dy)
            if neighbor in vertices:
                edge = (vertex, neighbor)
                edges.add(edge)
                weights[edge] = 1
    return (vertices, edges, weights)
  ```

</Admonition> 

### Reachable Cells

Implement a function `reachable_cells` which returns the set
of cells of a maze which are reachable from
the cell `source`.

<figure>
<video style="width:100%;margin-left:0; margin-right:0;" controls>
  <source src="../reachable.webm"  type="video/webm" />
</video>
<figcaption>
Computation of the cells reachable from the top-left corner. 
The green cells are reachable cells whose neighbors 
have between inspected; orange cells are reachable, 
but their neighbors have not yet been inspected;
Two groups of empty cells stay white until the end, 
and hence are unreachable.
</figcaption>
</figure>



<Admonition type="solution" open={debug}>

```python
def reachable_cells(maze, source):
    vertices, edges, _ = maze_to_graph(maze)
    todo = {source}
    done = set()
    while todo:
        current = todo.pop()
        neighbors = {
            v for v in vertices 
            if (current, v) in edges
        }
        for n in neighbors:
            if n not in done:
                todo.add(n)
        done.add(current)
    return done
```
</Admonition>

Extend the function `draw_maze` to graphically differentiate
a set of cells using a given color. 
Then use it to represent the set
of cells reachable from the top left corner of the maze
`random_maze`.

<Admonition type="solution" open={debug}>

```python
LIGHT_GREEN = 11

def draw_maze(maze, cells=None):
    display(BLACK)
    display(maze, WHITE, maze)
    if cells is not None:
        display(cells, LIGHT_GREEN)
```

```python
TOP_LEFT = (0, 0)

cells = reachable_cells(random_maze, source=TOP_LEFT)

pyxel.init(WIDTH, HEIGHT)
draw_maze(maze=random_maze, cells=cells)
pyxel.show()
```

</Admonition>


### Mazes and Paths

<Admonition type="task" open>
Implement a function `path_from` which takes as arguments:

  - `maze`: a 30x30 maze,

  - `source`: a source cell,

and returns

    - `path`: a dictionary whose keys are cells and
        whose values are paths. 
        
The path `path[target]` must join `source` and `target` if `target` is reachable
from `source`; otherwise, `target` must not be a key of the dictionary.
</Admonition>

</video>
<figcaption>

together with the path effectively used to joing them (in pink).
</figcaption>
</figure>

<Admonition type="solution" open={debug}>

A possible solution is:

```python
def path_from(maze, source):
    vertices, edges, _ = maze_to_graph(maze)
    todo = set()
    done = set()
    path = {}
    if source in maze:
       todo.add(source)
       path[source] = [source]
    while todo:
        current = todo.pop()
        neighbors = {
            v for v in vertices 
            if (current, v) in edges
        }
        for n in neighbors:
            if n not in done and n not in todo:
                path[n] = path[current] + [n]
                todo.add(n)
        done.add(current)
    return path
```
</Admonition>

Use this function to find a path joining the top left and bottom right corners
of the maze `random_maze` and graphically represent the result by updating
your function `draw_maze`.

import mazePath from "/src/assets/maze-path.png";


<figure>
<Image src={mazePath} alt="Path to the bottom right corner" style="border-radius: 0.375rem;margin-left:0; margin-right:0;"/>
<figcaption>
A path that joins the top left corner and the bottom right one (in pink).
</figcaption>
</figure>

<Admonition type="solution" open={debug}>

We can extend our function `draw_maze` as follows:

```python
PINK = 14

def draw_maze(maze, cells=None, path=None):
    display(BLACK)
    display(maze, WHITE, maze)
    if cells is not None:
        display(cells, LIGHT_GREEN)
    if path is not None:
        display(path, PINK)
```

and use it like that:

```python
target_to_path = path_from(random_maze, TOP_LEFT)
BOTTOM_RIGHT = (WIDTH - 1, HEIGHT - 1)
path = target_to_path[BOTTOM_RIGHT]
draw_maze(random_maze, path=path)
```
</Admonition>

Go back to the snake game of the previous session, discard the user inputs
and instead use your brand new path finding algorithm to select the snake
next move.

### Optimal Paths

Can you find on the previous map targets where the path found
is not of minimal length?

Implement a function `shortest_path_from(maze, origin)` which returns a
dictionary whose keys are the cells reachable from the origin
and the values one of the associated shortest paths (requiring the least
number of movements) joining the source and the target.

You can test your result graphically by invoking `draw_maze`
as in the previous question.

[The map of the lengths of the shortest paths from the top left corner (purple
for small numbers, yellow for large numbers).](images/optimal-map.jpg)


<Admonition type="solution" open={debug}>

By construction, if at each target cell the associated path is the shortest
possible, the lengths of the paths between two neighboring empty cells can
differ only by -1, 0 or 1.
Therefore, it is sufficient to observe large color differences
between neighboring cells of the map (corresponding to a difference in
length equal to at least two) to conclude that we have found a non-optimal path.
And this is indeed the case in a few places on the map of the lengths
associated with the `path_from` algorithm.

We will develop a new algorithm `shortest_path_from` which will
guarantee that the length is actually minimal.


```python
import math

def shortest_path_from(maze, source): 
    vertices, edges, weight = maze_to_graph(maze)
    distance, path = {}, {}
    todo = {source}
    distance[source] = 0
    path[source] = [source]
    while todo:
        current = todo.pop()
        neighbors = {
            v for v in vertices 
            if (current, v) in edges
        }
        for n in neighbors:
            d = distance[current] + weight[(current, n)]
            if d < distance.get(n, math.inf):
                distance[n] = d
                path[n] = path[current] + [n]
                todo.add(n)
    return path
```

We can display the corresponding map of lengths:


```python
target_to_path = shortest_path_from(random_maze, TOP_LEFT)
map = {
    target: len(path) - 1 
    for target, path in target_to_path.items()
}
draw_maze(random_maze, map=map)
```
